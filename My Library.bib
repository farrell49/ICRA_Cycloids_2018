The kinematic relations of the mechanism with a given speed-reduction ratio are analyzed; accordingly, the profiles of the sun cam and ring cam, key elements of the mechanism, are obtained. Furthermore, the condition for undercutting avoidance of the ring cam is derived. For mechanical design, different layouts of the epicyclic cam trains are discussed for the structure and transmission optimization. Finally, an epicyclic cam-roller speed reducer is designed and prototyped.},

Whereas the outer rotor profile is based on a curve equidistant to a hypotrochoidal (or extended hypocycloid) curve, the inner rotor design generally depends upon type of use—e.g., when used as a speed reducer, it is a pin wheel. Therefore, this analysis proposes designs for both a gerotor and a speed reducer. Specifically, for an inner rotor used as a gerotor pump, it outlines a mathematical model to improve pump efficiency and derives a dimensionless equation of nonundercutting. For the speed reducer, it develops and demonstrates with numerical examples, a feasible design region without undercutting on the tooth profile or interference between the adjacent pins.},

	abstract = {A new design of a two-stage cycloidal speed reducer is presented in this paper. A traditional two-stage cycloidal speed reducer is obtained by the simple combination of single-stage cycloidal speed reducers. A single-stage reducer engages two identical cycloid discs in order to balance dynamical loads and to obtain uniform load distribution. Consequently, the traditional two-stage reducer has four cycloid discs, in total. The newly designed two-stage cycloidal speed reducer, presented in this paper, has one cycloid disc for each stage, that is, two cycloid discs in total, which means that it is rather compact. Due to its specific concept, this reducer is characterized by good load distribution and dynamic balance, and this is described in the paper. Stress state analysis of cycloidal speed reducer elements was also realized, using the finite elements method ({FEM}), for the most critical cases of conjugate gear action (one, two, or three pairs of teeth in contact). The results showed that cycloid discs are rather uniformly loaded, justifying the design solution presented here. Experimental analysis of the stress state for cycloid discs was realized, using the strain gauges method. It is easy to conclude, based on the obtained results, that even for the most critical case (one pair of teeth in contact) stresses on cycloid discs are in the allowed limits, thus providing normal functioning of the reducer for its anticipated lifetime.},

	abstract = {The form-closure and force-closure properties of robotic grasp ing are investigated. Loosely speaking, these properties are related to the capability of the robot to inhibit motions of the workpiece in spite of externally applied forces. In this article, form-closure is considered as a purely geometric property of a set of unilateral (contact) constraints, such as those applied on a workpiece by a mechanical fixture, while force-closure is related to the capability of the particular robotic device being considered to apply forces through contacts. The concepts of partial form- and force-closure properties are introduced and discussed, and an algorithm is proposed to obtain a synthetic geometric description of partial form-closure constraints. Al though the literature abounds with form-closure tests, proposed algorithms for testing force-closure are either approximate or computationally expensive. This article proves the equiva lence of force-closure analysis with the study of the equilibria of an ordinary differential equation, to which Lyapunov's di rect method is applied. This observation leads to an efficient algorithm for assessing the force-closure property of the grasp.},

At first, design software is developed to conduct geometric design of the trochoidal gear reducers in {AutoCAD} software surrounding. With the help of developed software, gearing parameters and structural dimensions of the trochoidal gear reducers can be determined very simply. Two-dimensional (2D), drawings of the designed reducers can be drawn by the software automatically. Three-dimensional (3D), drawings of the designed reducers can also be drawn very quickly with 3D commands of {AutoCAD} software when the 2D drawings are available. The developed software can not only save much time of designers, but also makes it possible for inexperienced designers to be able to design the trochoidal gear reducers freely. Secondly a new mechanics model and finite element method ({FEM}) are presented in this paper to conduct loaded gear contact analysis of the trochoidal gear reducers in order to solve strength calculation and evaluation problems of the reducers. With the help of the model and {FEM} presented, it becomes practical to be able to conduct loaded gear contact analysis and strength calculations of the trochoidal gear reducers in theory. {FEM} software is developed based on the model and method. With the help of the developed {FEM} software, loads and contact stresses distributed on teeth, bushes and rollers of the trochoidal gear reducers are analyzed successfully. Bending stresses of the trochoidal gear are also analyzed, though it is rare for the reducer to have bending failures.},

Subsequently, kinematic errors are analyzed by using the tooth contact analysis, and the results caused by different combinations of the gear profile modifications are presented quantitatively.

The dynamic characteristics of these small teeth difference designs, however, remain unclear. Hence, this study constructs an analytic model of system dynamics in a cycloid reducer with a small tooth difference. Specifically, taking a transmission ratio of 17 as an example, it analyzes both free-pin and fixed-pin designs to show the shortcomings of traditional designs. It then proposes a nonpin design that improves on these shortcomings, one in which the pinwheel is replaced by a cycloid internal gear. Next, adopting the theory of gearing, it constructs a mathematical model of the nonpin design with a multitooth difference and derives undercutting equations to check for the persistence of undercutting on the tooth profile. It also determines the parameter design range of nonundercutting. In an analysis of system dynamics, it then investigates twelve nonpin cases with a small tooth difference, showing the effect of the design parameters on the reducer's system dynamics. The results indicate that appropriate design parameters can indeed improve on the shortcomings of the traditional design.},

To do so, a system dynamics analysis model of a cycloidal speed reducer is constructed, together with dynamics analysis models for two design types: A traditional pinwheel design and a nonpinwheel design (i.e., a design in which a cycloid internal gear replaces the pinwheel). Based on the theory of gearing, a mathematical model of the pinwheel with pins, cycloidal gear, and cycloid internal gear is then built from which the component geometry can be derived. These dynamics analysis models, constructed concurrently, are used to investigate the components' movements and stress variations, and determine the differences between the transmission mechanisms. The results indicate that the nonpinwheel design effectively reduces vibration, stress value, and stress fluctuation, thereby enhancing performance. An additional torsion test further suggests that the nonpinwheel design's output rate is superior to that of the traditional pinwheel design.},

	abstract = {Harmonic drives are profusely used in aerospace mainly because of their compactness and large reduction ratio. However, their use in cryogenic environments is still a challenge. Lubrication and fatigue are non-trivial issues under these conditions. The objective of the Magnetic-Superconductor Cryogenic Non-contact Harmonic Drive ({MAGDRIVE}) project, funded by the {EU} Space {FP}7, is to design, build, and test a new concept of {MAGDRIVE}. Non-contact interactions among magnets, soft magnetic materials, and superconductors are efficiently used to provide a high reduction ratio gear that smoothly and naturally operates at cryogenic environments. The limiting elements of conventional harmonic drives (teeth, flexspline, and ball bearings) are substituted by contactless mechanical components (magnetic gear and superconducting magnetic bearings). The absence of contact between moving parts prevents wear, lubricants are no longer required, and the operational lifetime is greatly increased. This is the first mechanical reducer in mechanical engineering history without any contact between moving parts. In this paper, the test results of a −1:20 inverse reduction ratio {MAGDRIVE} prototype are reported. In these tests, successful operation at 40 K and 10−3 Pa was demonstrated for more than 1.5 million input cycles. A maximum torque of 3 N·m and an efficiency of 80\% were demonstrated. The maximum tested input speed was 3000 rpm, six times the previous existing record for harmonic drives at cryogenic temperatures.},

The tooth profile of the cycloid gear is the equidistant curve of the cycloid, and that of the envelop internal gear is conjugated curve which takes the tooth profile of the cycloid gear as the generating curve. Therefore, the cycloid gear and the internal gear always mesh each other, without meshing boundary points. The reliability model of the cycloid double enveloping meshing pair based on the first contact line is established after the comparison of the composite curvature radius at the two types contact lines. The tooth profile's contact stress for the meshing pair at the first type contacting point is calculated by Hertz contact method and {FEA} (Finite Element Analysis). Under the assumption that contact strength and the contact stress satisfy with normal distribution, the reliability design model of the cycloid double enveloping meshing pair is analyzed. The results show that the reliability of the cycloid double enveloping meshing is quite high.},

This paper describes the design parameters for cycloid drives and shows the results of six cycloid models designed to match corresponding harmonic drives. Cycloid drive models were compared with manufacturing data from corresponding harmonic drives with respect to maximum gear ratio, transmission thickness, efficiency, backlash/gear ratio ripple, and reflected inertia. Cycloid drive designs were found to be thinner, more efficient, and to have lower reflected inertia than corresponding harmonic drives. However, the cycloid designs had larger gear ratio ripple and substantial backlash, and they could not meet the maximum gear ratio provided by the corresponding harmonic drives in two out of six models for equal applied torques. Two cycloid drives were manufactured to confirm efficiency predictions and demonstrated moderate to high efficiency across a range of output torques. Cycloid drives should be considered for robotic and prosthetic applications where smaller thickness/higher efficiency requirements dominate over low backlash/gear ratio ripple considerations.},

	abstract = {Subjects were asked to shape the right hand as if to grasp and use a large number of familiar objects. The chosen objects typically are held with a variety of grips, including “precision” and “power” grips. Static hand posture was measured by recording the angular position of 15 joint angles of the fingers and of the thumb. Although subjects adopted distinct hand shapes for the various objects, the joint angles of the digits did not vary independently. Principal components analysis showed that the first two components could account for \&gt;80\% of the variance, implying a substantial reduction from the 15 degrees of freedom that were recorded. However, even though they were small, higher-order (more than three) principal components did not represent random variability but instead provided additional information about the object. These results suggest that the control of hand posture involves a few postural synergies, regulating the general shape of the hand, coupled with a finer control mechanism providing for small, subtle adjustments. Because the postural synergies did not coincide with grip taxonomies, the results suggest that hand posture may be regulated independently from the control of the contact forces that are used to grasp an object.},
