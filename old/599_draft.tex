\section{INTRODUCTION}

Humanoid robots provide the capability to operate a robot in the same space, using the same tools that a human can. The vision of the future of these robots can clearly be seen with efforts for robots to go into disaster areas unsafe for humans \cite{DRC} or help humans do menial tasks \cite{missing}. Perhaps the single largest capability necessary to accomplish these human tasks is the ability to manipulate the same objects that humans can. For this challenge, many designers have created hands capable of nearly all of the degrees of freedom as the human hand \cite{r2_hand}, \cite{DRL}, \cite{missing}. However, while the hands are capable of forming many of the same grips and poses as a human hand, the control of these hands in an intuitive, and simple way has yet to be implemented. Until the community can quickly and effectively control these large degree of freedom (DoF humanoid hands, robots will still need to be highly specialized for individual tasks. \par
Research shows that humans control their hands not with individual joint signals, like are required for robotic hands, but instead by a single signal that actuates multiple muscle groups, that combine to create the plethora of hand motions humans can form \cite{Santello} \cite{neuro}. This approach gives a method for decreasing the commanded DOF of the hand system to a more managable number, this method is referred to as synergies. However, these synergies still mimic the motions of the human hand, which are difficult to intuitively combine into useful hand motions, shifting the complexity problem from degrees of freedom, to nonintuitive combinations. \par
In this research, the authors propose a method to create a single degree of freedom synergy for Robonaut 2's hand with 20 DOF, 12 of which are actuated, based on a simple shape. Using the concept of building a movement relationship proposed in previous research, the authors build this relationship around simple parameters, like a cylinders volume, to command the robot. This allows the robot to successfully manipulate any cylindrical object found in an every day environment with only a single model.  

\section{BACKGROUND}


	Dexterous manipulation has developed from a simple parallel gripper towards the complexity of motion of the human hand in the past decades. This high DoF system similar to the human hand allows robots to manipulate objects in similar ways to a human, allowing intuitive control of the hand. However, as this problem has been studied further, while construction of robotic hands with similar or the same DoFs as the human hand \cite{yanko_2015_analysis} has become common place, the control is anything but intuitive. The computational costs to calculate the correct closing position around a given object as perceived by a robotic vision system is 
$$
f(x) = O(2^N)  \eqno{(1)}
$$
where N = DoF because each DoF needs to be controlled individually. This has led to many studies regarding the way that humans control our own hands with hopes of extending that same control scheme to a robotic hand. 

The seminal work by Marco Santello [1], as well as many others, has demonstrated that the human brain does not have a specific section that moves the distal ring finger joint, and another for the proximal joint, etc. Instead, our brain will send high level commands down through the motor cortex to do sets of actions, and these will travel down the spine and activate sets of muscles in combination, rather than just single muscle groups. In this way, our brain is grouping and combining sets of commands in different ways to accomplish the task [2].  These groupings of commands are referred to as synergies. Santello’s research performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a large range of every day grasps, and was able to model 50$\%$ of all grasps with a single relationship or synergy. If a second synergy is added in proportion, roughly 80$\%$  of all grasps can be commanded, the third synergy results in over 90$\%$  of observed grasps. This demonstrates how our brain is potentially reducing the 20 DoF problem of hand motion into only a few DoFs. This greatly reduces the complexity of grasping for humans and allows them to smoothly control a very large number of DoFs to accomplishgrasping  tasks without a large burden of the nervous system. 

 Engineers can draw inspiration from this structure to design robotic grasping devices.  A synergistic scheme can be implemented in several ways.  Human hand synergies can be used to identify key DoFs that are necessary for a simplified hand design.  They can also be used to devise underactuation schemes such as the PISA-IIT softhand.  Finally, they can be used to simplify the control of fully actuated hands by creating "Software Synergies" \cite{catalona_2012_adaptive}.  This type of scheme was demonstrated by Ciorcarlie et. al. in 2007 \cite{ciocarlie_2007_dextrous}.  The group used the GraspIt software simulation to map the two primary human postural synergies to fully actuated robotic hands.  We aim to further this work by using the SynGrasp software because it is well suited to designing synergy schemes and testing them using kinematics.  We also aim to create our own unique purpose-driven synergy scheme instead of mapping human synergies.

Robonaut 2 is a humanoid upper torso robot with 7DoF legs that is currently onboard the International Space Station. The design goal of this robot is to help astronauts with repetitive tasks on station like monitoring airflow, cleaning handrails, unpacking resupply vehicles etc. \cite{diftler_2011_humanoid}. Currently, NASA is actively developing technologies to allow this robot to behave with more autonomy to allow supervised control over long time delays so the robot could be accomplishing tasks while in orbit in an unmanned module around Mars. To achieve this level of autonomy and dexterity, setting specific control of each joint, for each hand pose to manipulate each known object creates a monstrous design and test issue. Each object to be manipulated must be modeled, the approach trajectories made and tested, and the hand positions required made and verified. However, if the commands to control grasps can be decreased from 20 DoF to 1 DoF, this task becomes much simpler. Instead of each individual object, a single cylindrical object could be made and verified. Then, any object the robot encounters that it could classify as a cylinder, it has a manipulation model for. The application of synergies in this case will save time and effort while increasing the capability and usefulness of the dexterous robot.   

The synergy matrix can be defined in (2).
$$
q = S\sigma  \eqno{(2)}
$$

Where q, is the vector of joint angles, S is the synergy matrix, and is the synergy activation vector.

	SynGrasp is a MATLAB toolbox developed at the University of Sienna for the purpose of simulating “Underactuated Robot Grasping” \cite{salvetti_2016_synergies}.  This toolbox provides three helpful capabilities: it allows the user to model robotic hands, perform grasp simulations and analysis, and map synergies on to robot hand designs.   The ability to create user defined hand models and synergies makes this an ideal tool to use to simulating a synergy based command structure for R2.  A computational tool for modeling grasps and commands for R2 would be hugely beneficial for evaluation of the hand and for designing grips for it.  While the main purpose of this study is to evaluate a synergy command architecture to R2, it will have the added objective of evaluating the use and accuracy of Syngrasp simulations in real-world environments.


\section{METHODS}

	The objective of this studyt is to build the commanding infrastructure for R2 to take the inputs of synergy type (ex. “cylinder”) and the single variable (diameter) and calculate the synergy matrix S from these two inputs. That synergy matrix will need to then be passed to a new joint commander interface to command the fingers joints to the calculated angles. This is a low-level implementation step that is needed for testing and validation. 

The first phase is to determine the finger angles for grasps of cylinders of varying diameter using SynGrasp.  The chosen diameters were 0.5 in, 1 in, 1.5 in, 2 in, 3 in , and 4 in.  The modeled grasps were validated by loading them onto Robotnaut and experimentally checking that the grasps would perform on the actual system as they did in the model.  Robonaut was given the piece of cylindrical aluminum pipe on a tabletop and the predetermined angles from the SynGrasp simulation.  To perform a successful trial, Robonaut would grasp the object on the tabletop, lift it, and perform a series on manipulations to ensure that it is a firm grasp and the object will not be dropped.  The grasps were tested and refined in this way to account for some of the model's discrepancies compared to the real-life system.
	
Following modeling and validation, each joint angle from each grasp was curve-fit using a nth-order polynomial with grasp diameter as the input.  This single-input set of polynomials serves as our synergy matrix for cylindrical grasps.  The cylindrical grasp synergy matrix was tested on cylindrical  objects of varying diameter and weight. 



\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if your filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named �Heading 1�, �Heading 2�, �Heading 3�, and �Heading 4� are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation �Fig. 1�, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline
Three & Four\\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


   \begin{figure}[thpb]
      \centering
      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.
}}
      %\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figurefile}
      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}
   

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity �Magnetization�, or �Magnetization, M�, not just �M�. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write �Magnetization (A/m)� or �Magnetization {A[m(1)]}�, not just �A/m�. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write �Temperature (K)�, not �Temperature/K.�

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions.
