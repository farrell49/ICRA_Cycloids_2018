	abstract = {This paper deals with design and strength analyses of trochoidal gear reducers. At first, design software is developed to conduct geometric design of the trochoidal gear reducers in {AutoCAD} software surrounding. With the help of developed software, gearing parameters and structural dimensions of the trochoidal gear reducers can be determined very simply. Two-dimensional (2D), drawings of the designed reducers can be drawn by the software automatically. Three-dimensional (3D), drawings of the designed reducers can also be drawn very quickly with 3D commands of {AutoCAD} software when the 2D drawings are available. The developed software can not only save much time of designers, but also makes it possible for inexperienced designers to be able to design the trochoidal gear reducers freely. Secondly a new mechanics model and finite element method ({FEM}) are presented in this paper to conduct loaded gear contact analysis of the trochoidal gear reducers in order to solve strength calculation and evaluation problems of the reducers. With the help of the model and {FEM} presented, it becomes practical to be able to conduct loaded gear contact analysis and strength calculations of the trochoidal gear reducers in theory. {FEM} software is developed based on the model and method. With the help of the developed {FEM} software, loads and contact stresses distributed on teeth, bushes and rollers of the trochoidal gear reducers are analyzed successfully. Bending stresses of the trochoidal gear are also analyzed, though it is rare for the reducer to have bending failures.},

	abstract = {Harmonic and cycloid drives are both compact, high ratio transmissions appropriate for use in anthropomorphic robots, although cycloid drives are rarely used in the field. This paper describes the design parameters for cycloid drives and shows the results of six cycloid models designed to match corresponding harmonic drives. Cycloid drive models were compared with manufacturing data from corresponding harmonic drives with respect to maximum gear ratio, transmission thickness, efficiency, backlash/gear ratio ripple, and reflected inertia. Cycloid drive designs were found to be thinner, more efficient, and to have lower reflected inertia than corresponding harmonic drives. However, the cycloid designs had larger gear ratio ripple and substantial backlash, and they could not meet the maximum gear ratio provided by the corresponding harmonic drives in two out of six models for equal applied torques. Two cycloid drives were manufactured to confirm efficiency predictions and demonstrated moderate to high efficiency across a range of output torques. Cycloid drives should be considered for robotic and prosthetic applications where smaller thickness/higher efficiency requirements dominate over low backlash/gear ratio ripple considerations.},

	shorttitle = {Traditional versus improved designs for cycloidal speed reducers with a small tooth difference},
	abstract = {Whereas traditional cycloid reducers tend to have a one tooth difference design, a two teeth difference design is common when the transmission ratio is low (≦ 17). The dynamic characteristics of these small teeth difference designs, however, remain unclear. Hence, this study constructs an analytic model of system dynamics in a cycloid reducer with a small tooth difference. Specifically, taking a transmission ratio of 17 as an example, it analyzes both free-pin and fixed-pin designs to show the shortcomings of traditional designs. It then proposes a nonpin design that improves on these shortcomings, one in which the pinwheel is replaced by a cycloid internal gear. Next, adopting the theory of gearing, it constructs a mathematical model of the nonpin design with a multitooth difference and derives undercutting equations to check for the persistence of undercutting on the tooth profile. It also determines the parameter design range of nonundercutting. In an analysis of system dynamics, it then investigates twelve nonpin cases with a small tooth difference, showing the effect of the design parameters on the reducer's system dynamics. The results indicate that appropriate design parameters can indeed improve on the shortcomings of the traditional design.},

	abstract = {Cycloidal speed reducers are composed primarily of an eccentric shaft, output parts, and a set comprising a cycloidal gear and pinwheel with pins or a cycloidal gear and cycloid internal gear. This paper investigates the contact and collision conditions of these components, as well as their stress variations during the transmission process. To do so, a system dynamics analysis model of a cycloidal speed reducer is constructed, together with dynamics analysis models for two design types: A traditional pinwheel design and a nonpinwheel design (i.e., a design in which a cycloid internal gear replaces the pinwheel). Based on the theory of gearing, a mathematical model of the pinwheel with pins, cycloidal gear, and cycloid internal gear is then built from which the component geometry can be derived. These dynamics analysis models, constructed concurrently, are used to investigate the components' movements and stress variations, and determine the differences between the transmission mechanisms. The results indicate that the nonpinwheel design effectively reduces vibration, stress value, and stress fluctuation, thereby enhancing performance. An additional torsion test further suggests that the nonpinwheel design's output rate is superior to that of the traditional pinwheel design.},

	abstract = {This paper uses the theory of gearing to derive the mathematical model of an internal cycloidal gear with tooth difference. Whereas the outer rotor profile is based on a curve equidistant to a hypotrochoidal (or extended hypocycloid) curve, the inner rotor design generally depends upon type of use—e.g., when used as a speed reducer, it is a pin wheel. Therefore, this analysis proposes designs for both a gerotor and a speed reducer. Specifically, for an inner rotor used as a gerotor pump, it outlines a mathematical model to improve pump efficiency and derives a dimensionless equation of nonundercutting. For the speed reducer, it develops and demonstrates with numerical examples, a feasible design region without undercutting on the tooth profile or interference between the adjacent pins.},
