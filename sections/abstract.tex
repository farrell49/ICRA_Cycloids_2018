Currently, harmonic drives are the go-to speed reducer for robotic applications where a high reduction in a small package is required. 
Cycloidal drives have the ability to customize a high reduction drive that can carry high torque in a small package. 
These compact style cycloidal drives have been well studied in theory and simulation for their performance, but very little data is available on their actual performance over time. 
This paper presents experimental data on performance of a cycloidal drive designed for a robotic application. 
Burn-in time efficiency curves, and efficiency profiles over time are computer after running the drive through 51K output cycles (3M input cycles) over the course of 111 hours of testing. 
The study finds that substantial burn-in time may be required for steady-state performance, but peak efficiencies of 80\% can be achieved. 
Also, the efficiency is shown to be dependant on the torque through the actuator.
This work demonstrates a customized cycloidal drive in a robotic application that is comparable to a harmonic drive in performance, suggesting the application of cycloidal drives could grow tremendously in robotic designs.
